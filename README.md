# UI/UX Code Challenge

## Task
In this code challenge you will be required to make an application that:
1. Implements authentication (User can login and logout)
2. The user can create a list of contacts and saves it to a DB of your choice
3. The user can send airtime to the contacts/phone numbers using the Africa's Talking Airtime API

##### You are free to use any language or framework of choice

## Resources
- [API Reference](http://docs.africastalking.com/)
- [Helper libraries](https://github.com/AfricasTalkingLtd)
- [Sandbox](https://account.africastalking.com/apps/sandbox)
- [Simulator](https://simulator.africastalking.com:1517/)


## Tips
###### After signup, navigate to the sandbox(big orange button) which youâ€™ll use to build your test app. Your API key is in settings. A link to the simulator is also in the sandbox.
###### You are free to build using any language, using the available SDKs or the API directly. We advise building a clean simple form that allows you to send airtime to multiple phone numbers in one request(form input accepting multiple entries)
###### The documentation is your friend. Carefully go through it, learn how the API works
###### Extra points for good user experience, form validation, single page applications
